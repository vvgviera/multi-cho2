Operation: TURP Anesthesia: Spinal Description of procedure: The patient was placed on the operating room table in a sitting position and spinal anesthesia induced. He was placed in the lithotomy position, prepped and draped appropriately. Resection began at the posterior bladder neck and extended to the verumontanum (a crest near the wall of the urethra). Posterior tissue was resected first from the left lateral lobe, then right lateral lobe, then anterior. Depth of resection was carried to the level of the circular fibers. Bleeding vessels were electrocauterized as encountered. Care was taken to not resect distal to the verumontanum, thus protecting the external sphincter. At the end of the procedure, prostatic chips were evacuated from the bladder. Final inspection showed good hemostasis and intact verumontanum.

The patient was brought to the operating room, given a general anesthetic and prepped in the usual fashion. His urethra was intubated with a resectoscope sheath. He had a normal urethra and extremely large prostate gland. His bladder was full of clots. These were evacuated. Approximately 250mL of thick dark old clot was evacuated. After the clot was cleared there was apparently a normal bladder with no evidence of any tumors. The prostate was extremely large, and there was some bleeding from the surface.

                <p>Pregunta 41: The patient has significant morbid obesity and her pannus has been retracted to help with dissection. The planned procedure is to place a catheter/tube to drain the bladder. It is apparent she has quite a bit of scarring from her previous surgeries and appears to have an old sinus tract just above the symphysis. A midline incision is made following her old scar from just above the symphysis for a length of about 4-6cm. The sinus tract was excised, as this was also in the midline, and carefully dissected down to the level of the fascia. It does not appear to be an actual hernia, as there are no ventral contents within it. Again, there is quite a bit of distortion from previous scarring because of the obesity, but staying in the midline, the fascia is incised just above the symphysis of a length of about 2cm. The fat and scar are incised above the fascia more superiorly and with palpation, mesh from a previous hernia repair is felt. This was not palpable prior to the incision because of her body habitus. The mesh was not exposed or entered, it comes down quite close to the symphysis and certainly is too close to place a suprapubic (SP) tube. There is concern the mesh may become infected with an SP tube tract right there. Therefore, decision to abort the procedure is made.

                <p>Pregunta 44: Dr. Smith is treating a 72-year-old female with ureteral obstruction caused by a postoperative stricture and post radiation scarring following treatment for transitional cell cancer. The patient requires removal and replacement of an internal indwelling ureteral stent. Dr. Smith advances a diagnostic catheter under conscious sedation into the bladder and injects contrast to opacity the bladder. A guide wire is advanced into the bladder and the diagnostic catheter is exchanged for a larger catheter to allow the use of a snare device. Under the fluoroscopic guidance the snare device is negotiated into the bladder through the sheath and used to grasp the pigtail portion of the double-J ureteral stent tube within the bladder and the indwelling stent tube is pulled out of the bladder and urethra far enough to allow retrograde introduction of a guide wire through the stent, directed into the renal pelvis. Using fluoroscopic guidance to negotiate the wire through the inner lumen of the ureteral stent tube rather than through side holes, a diagnostic catheter is positioned over the wire into the renal pelvis, allowing opacification and visualization of the renal pelvis. The guide wire is repositioned into the renal pelvis and the diagnostic catheter removed. A new double-J ureteral stent tube is introduced and positioned. The guide, sheath and safety wire are removed after appropriate position is confirmed with fluoroscopy and a permanent image is obtained for the medical record.
