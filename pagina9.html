                <p>Pregunta 18: A 63-year-old man sustained a gunshot wound through the right maxillary sinus penetrating into the right neck. CT scan revealed no hard evidence of arterial injury but a bullet was directly in line with the internal jugular vein. He was sent to the operating room for neck exploration to rule out vascular injury and injury to the aerodigestive tract (respiratory and digestive tracts). A sternocleidomastoid incision was performed and carried down through the platysma muscle. There was no penetration of the internal jugular vein, but a foreign body was identified resting on the internal jugular vein at approximately the level of the angle of the mandible and it was removed. The parotid gland was noted to have a blast injury near the tail. This was not surgically repaired or resected. Once all bleeding was controlled, a 10 French round drain was placed in the wound.

                <p>Pregunta 19:  A 66-year-old sustained a left proximal humerus fracture. Standard deltopectoral approach was used and dissection was carried down to the fracture site. The fracture site was identified and fragments were mobilized and the humeral head fragments removed. Once this was done, the stem was prepared up to a size 10. A trial reduction was carried out with the DePuy trial stem and implant head. Sutures were placed in key positions for closure of the tuberosities down to the shaft including sutures through the shaft. The shaft was then prepared and cement was injected into the shaft. The implant was placed. Once the cement was hardened, the head was placed on Morse taper and reduced. A bone graft was placed around the area where the tuberosities were being brought down. The tuberosities were then tied down with a suture previously positioned. This gave excellent closure and coverage of the significant motion at the repair sites. The wound was thoroughly irrigated. The skin was closed with Vicryl over a drain and also staples in the epidermis. A sterile dressing and sling was applied. The patient was taken to recovery in stable condition. No immediate complications. What CPT® code is reported?   </p>

                <p>Pregunta 26: A patient presented with a right ankle fracture. After induction of general anesthesia, the right leg was elevated and draped in the usual manner for surgery. A longitudinal incision was made parallel and posterior to the fibula. It was curved anteriorly to its distal end. The skin flap was developed and retracted anteriorly. The distal fibula fracture was then reduced and held with reduction forceps. A lag screw was inserted from anterior to posterior across the fracture. A 5hole 1/3 tubular plate was then applied to the lateral contours of the fibula with cortical and cancellous bone screws. Final radiographs showed restoration of the fibula.

She has opted for more definitive treatment. After induction of anesthesia, the patient’s left arm was prepared and draped in the normal sterile fashion. Local anesthetic was injected using a combination 2% lidocaine and 0.25% Marcaine. A transverse incision was made over the central area of the first dorsal compartment. The subcutaneous tissues were gently spread to protect the neural and venous structures. The retractors were placed. The fascial sheath of the first dorsal compartment was then incised and opened carefully. The underlying thumb abductor and extensor tendons were identified. The tissues were dissected and the extensor retinaculum of the first extensor compartment was incised. The fibrotic tissue was incised and the tendons gently released. The tendons were freely moving.

                <p>Pregunta 44: Under general anesthesia, a 45-year-old patient was sterilely prepped. The wrist joint was injected with Marcaine and epinephrine. Three arthroscopic portals were created. The articulating surface between the scaphoid and the lunate clearly showed disruption of the ligamentous structures. We could see soft tissue pouching out into the joint; this was debrided. There was abnormal motion noted within the scapholunate articulation. At this point the C-arm was brought in. Arthroscopic instruments were placed in the joint and confirmed the location of the shaver as a probe in the scapholunate ligament. There was a significant gap between the capitate and lunate. K-wire was utilized from the dorsal surface into the lunate, restoring the space. Further examination revealed gross instability between the capitate and lunate. With the wrist in neutral position, a K-wire was passed through the scaphoid, through the capitate and into the hamate. This provided stabilization of the wrist joint. Stitches were placed, and a thumb spica cast was applied. What CPT® code(s) is/are reported? </p>

                <p>Pregunta 45: A 74-year-old male presented with ankle avascular necrosis of the talus with collapse of the body. After general anesthesia and sterile prep, the patient was placed prone. A lateral incision was made. The fibula was dissected and approximately 6 cm of the fibula was removed for the autograft. There were a lot of free fragments of bone around the subtalar joint and the talus itself. The bone fragments were removed and a large defect consistent with avascular necrosis of the body of the talus was noted. An egg-shaped burr was introduced and the articulating cartilage of the ankle joint was excised and debrided. The subtalar joint was approached and resection of the articulating surface of the subtalar joint was completed. Bone graft from the fibula was prepared on the back table. We made two large blocks to fill the defect in the talus and then additional small fragments of cortical cancellous bone to fill in smaller defects around the talus and ankle. Fixation was performed in the calcaneocuboid. The talar screw was inserted, followed by fixation of the talonavicular, tibiotalar and additional compression. The ankle screws were inserted proximally and the wound was irrigated and closed in layers. What CPT® codes are reported? </p>

                <p>Pregunta 46: The patient is a 17-year-old male who was struck on the elbow by another player’s stick while playing hockey. He is found to have a fracture of the olecranon process. The patient was brought to the OR, anesthetized and intubated. The right upper extremity was prepped with Betadine scrub and draped free in the usual sterile orthopedic manner. The arm was then elevated and exsanguinated and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mm/Hg. A five-inch incision was made with the scalpel on the extensor side of the elbow, beginning distally and proceeding in an oblique fashion up the proximal forearm. Dissection was carried through subcutaneous tissue and fascia, and bleeding was controlled with electrocautery. We then subperiosteally exposed the proximal ulna and olecranon to visualize the fracture site. The fracture could be seen at the base of the olecranon process. We irrigated the site thoroughly and reduced the fracture fragments without difficulty. Extending the elbow, we inserted two smooth K-wires across the fracture site. Through a drill hole in the proximal ulnar shaft, we threaded an 18gauge wire through it and wrapped it around the K-wires in a figure-of-eight manner to further stabilize the fixation. Wires were then twisted and placed into soft tissues. The K-wires in the olecranon were advanced slightly after being bent and cut. Sterile dressing was applied and the patient was placed in a splint. What CPT® code is reported?   </p>

                <p>Pregunta 47: This 56-year-old female presented with a degenerative posteromedial meniscal flap tear of the right knee. After appropriate preoperative evaluation, the patient was taken to the operating room where general anesthesia was instituted. The patient was placed supine on the operating table. The right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped for arthroscopic surgery. The leg was exsanguinated and the tourniquet inflated. The arthroscope was introduced first through the anterolateral portal with medial suprapatellar portal utilized. The lateral compartment looked fairly good. There were some minimal medial degenerative changes. In the medial compartment there was a full-thickness area of osteochondral degeneration with a flap of cartilage noted. It was possible to remove this with a bleeding bony bed with beveled edges of cartilage. The ligament itself was intact. The retropatellar area was normal with Grade I chondromalacia changes noted. The medial joint was inspected and there was a tear at the junction of the middle and posterior portions of the meniscus, a flap tear was based more anteriorly. This was shaved with a combination of small baskets and punches, and the meniscus debrided back to a smooth stable rim. There was additional synovitis in the medial aspect of the intercondylar notch and this was removed with the curved automated meniscal incisor.

                <p>Pregunta 48:  This 36-year-old female presents with an avulsed anterior cruciate ligament off the femoral condyle with a complete white on white horizontal cleavage tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus, causing instability. A general endotracheal anesthesia was performed, and the patient was placed supine on the operating table. The right lower extremity was prepped with Betadine and draped free. Standard arthroscopic portals were created, and the knee was systematically examined and probed. The posterior horn of the medial meniscus was noted to be buckled and frayed. This area was carefully probed and found to be irreparable. It was decided that our best option was to proceed with a limited partial meniscectomy, with the goal being to leave as much viable meniscal tissue as possible. Therefore, a medial infrapatellar portal was developed with a longitudinal stab wound. A series of straight-angled and curved basket punches was used to perform a saucerization of the damaged portion of the meniscus, leaving the intact portion of the medial meniscus in place. Debris was meticulously removed with the 4.0 meniscal cutter. Approximately 50% of the medial meniscus remained. Next, our attention was turned to the ACL repair. Through a 5 cm longitudinal anterior incision, a central one-third tendon bone was harvested. A 10 mm graft was taken and bone plug sculpted. Anterolateral notchplasty was done with a curette and polished with the burr. All debris was removed and instruments were used to ensure proper isometry. The graft was tightened in extension about 2.5 mm and actually lengthened in flexion, and this was considered acceptable. Endoscopic guides were used to create the tibial and femoral tunnels, and the edges were rasped smooth. Using a percutaneous guide pin, the graft was placed retrograde to the knee and secured proximally with an 8 x 25 mm interference screw. The knee was put through range of motion, and with the leg in 30 degrees of flexion with the posterior drawer applied to the proximal tibia; an 8 x 20 mm interference screw was used to secure the bone plug distally. The graft was tight, isometric and without adverse features. The wound was copiously irrigated with Kantrex1. Cancellous bone fragments from bone plugs were used to graft the donor site defect in the patella. The paratenon was closed over this to house the graft with a running #1 Vicryl. The edge of the distal bone plug was beveled with the rongeur. The subcutaneous tissue was closed with triple-0 Vicryl. Skin was closed with double-0 Prolene in a subcuticular fashion. Steri-Strips, sterile dressing, cryo cuff and hinged knee brace were applied. The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.

                <p>Pregunta 49: This patient presented with internal derangement of the left knee. After satisfactory anesthesia was administered for the arthroscopic procedure, the left lower extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. Routine portals were made in the knee. We first looked at the medial compartment which showed a complex small tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus. This was debrided using a 4.0 meniscal shaver. There was an area of grade 4 chondromalacia on the proximal medial distal femur and this was all the way down to bone. There was also evidence of chondromalacia over the patellofemoral joint of grade 4. This area was drilled with a 0.45 K-wire. Multiple drill holes were placed in an attempt to get some scar tissue to form. The notch area was normal and lateral compartment normal. Following microfracture technique, the knee was irrigated, each portal was closed with 4-0 nylon and the patient was taken to recovery.
