                <p>Pregunta 32:  Patient is a 53-year-old female who yesterday underwent Mohs surgery with Dr. Smith to remove a basal cell carcinoma of her scalp. Due to the size of the defect Dr. Smith requested a Plastic Surgeon to reconstruct the site. Dr. Jones discussed with the patient his planned closure, which was a Ying-Yang type flap. The patient agreed and we proceeded. The area was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion being careful to keep betadine solution out of the open wound. Wound preparation was done by excising an additional 1 mm margin to freshen the wound and excising the wound deeper. Starting on the right, Dr. Jones incised his planned flap, elevating the flap with full-thickness and subcutaneous fat, staying superior to the galea. Then Dr. Jones incised his planned flap on the left elevating the flap with full-thickness and subcutaneous fat. Both flaps were rotated together and the wound was temporarily closed using the skin stapler. Once it was determined there was minimal tension on the wound, the galea was approximated using 4.0 Monocryl. The wound was then closed in layers using 5-0 Monocryl and a 35R skin stapler. Meticulous hemostasis was achieved through-out the procedure with the Bovie cautery. Final measurements of the wound were 36.25 cm2.

					Pre-Operative Diagnoses: 
					Basal Cell Carcinoma, forehead Basal Cell Carcinoma, right cheek Suspicious lesion, left nose Suspicious lesion, left forehead 
					
					Post-Operative Diagnoses:        Basal Cell Carcinoma, forehead with clear margins Basal Cell Carcinoma, right cheek with clear margins Compound nevus, left nose with clear margins Epidermal nevus, left forehead with clear margins 
					
					INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: The patient is a 47-year-old white man with a biopsy proven basal cell carcinoma of his forehead and a biopsy proven basal cell carcinoma of his right cheek. We were not quite sure of the patient’s location of the basal cell carcinoma of the forehead whether it was a midline lesion or lesion to the left. We felt stronger about the midline lesion, so we marked the area for elliptical excision in relaxed skin tension lines of his forehead with gross normal margins of 1-2 mm and I marked the lesion of the left forehead for biopsy. He also had a lesion of his left alar crease we marked for biopsy and a large basal cell carcinoma of his right cheek, which was more obvious. This was marked for elliptical excision with gross normal margins of 2-3 mm in the relaxed skin tension lines of his face. I also drew a possible rhomboid flap that we would use if the wound became larger. He observed all these margins in the mirror, so he could understand the surgery and agree on the locations, and we proceeded. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: All four areas were infiltrated with local anesthetic. The face was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. I excised the lesion of the forehead measuring 6 mm and right cheek measuring 1.3 cm as I had drawn them and sent in for frozen section. The biopsies were taken of the left forehead and left nose using a 2-mm punch, and these wounds were closed with 6-0 Prolene. Meticulous hemostasis was achieved of those wounds using Bovie cautery. I closed the cheek wound first. Defects were created at each end of the wound to facilitate primary closure and because of this I considered a complex repair and the wound was closed in layers using 4-0 Monocryl, 5-0 Monocryl and 6-0 Prolene, with total measurement of 2.1 cm.

I marked the areas for excision with gross normal margins of 5 mm, and I drew my planned skin graft donor site from his left lateral thigh. He also had an open wound of his right leg from a squamous cell carcinoma excised four months ago; the skin graft had not taken. We plan on re-skin grafting the area. The patient is aware of all of these markings, and understands the surgery and location. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room. IV Ancef was given. I used plain lidocaine for his local anesthetic throughout the procedure until the skin grafts were inset. The anterior of his leg and the thigh were infiltrated with local anesthetic. Both lower extremities were prepped and draped circumferentially, which included the left thigh on the left side. I excised the lesion on his left leg as drawn into the subcutaneous fat. Hemostasis achieved with the Bovie cautery. I then excised the wound on his right leg to lower the bacterial counts. I took a 1-2 mm margin around the wound and excised the granulation tissue as well. Hemostasis was achieved using the Bovie cautery. I then changed gloves. A split-thickness skin graft was harvested from the left thigh using the Zimmer dermatome. This was meshed 1:5:1. By this time, the pathology returned showing the margins were clear. Skin grafts were inset on each leg wound using the skin stapler. Xeroform and gauze bolster was placed over the skin graft using 4-0 nylon. The skin graft donor site was dressed with OpSite. The legs were further dressed with heavy cast padding and the double Ace wrap. The patient tolerated the procedure well. PROCEDURES: Excision squamous cell carcinoma, left leg with excised diameter of 2.5 cm, repaired with a split-thickness skin graft measuring 5.1 cm2.

                <p>Pregunta 38:  The patient is seen in follow-up for excision of the basal cell carcinoma of his nose. I examined his nose noting the wound has healed well. His pathology showed the margins were clear. He has a mass on his forehead; he says it is from a fragment of sheet metal from an injury to his forehead. He has an X-ray showing a foreign body, and we have offered to remove it. After obtaining consent we proceeded. The area was infiltrated with local anesthetic. I had drawn for him how I would incise over the foreign body. He observed this in the mirror so he could understand the surgery and agree on the location. I incised a thin ellipse over the mass to give better access to it; the mass was removed. There was a granuloma capsule around this, containing what appeared to be a black-colored piece of stained metal; I felt it could potentially cause a permanent black mark on his forehead. I offered to excise the metal. He wanted me to, and so I went ahead and removed the capsule with the stain and removed all the black stain. I consider this to be a complicated procedure.

                <p>Pregunta 43: Operative Report PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diabetic foot ulceration.  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diabetic foot ulceration.  OPERATION PERFORMED: Debridement and split thickness autografting of left midfoot. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.  INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This patient with multiple complications from type 2 diabetes developed skin ulcerations which were debrided with homograft last week. The homograft is taking quite nicely; the wounds appear to be fairly clean. He is ready for autografting.  DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent the patient is brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table. Anesthetic monitoring was instituted; general anesthesia was induced. The left lower extremity is prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. Staples were removed and the homograft was debrided from the surface of the wounds. One wound appeared to have healed; the remaining two appeared to be relatively clean. We debrided this sharply with good bleeding in all areas. Hemostasis was achieved with pressure, Bovie cautery, and warm saline soaked sponges. With good hemostasis a donor site was then obtained on the left anterior thigh, measuring less than 100 cm2. The wounds were then grafted with a split-thickness autograft that was harvested with a patch of Brown dermatome set at 12,000 of an inch thick. This was meshed 1.5:1. The donor site was infiltrated with bupivacaine and dressed. The skin graft was then applied over the wound, measured approximately 60 cm2 in dimension on the left midfoot. This was secured into place with skin staples and was then dressed with Acticoat 18's, Kerlix incorporating a catheter, and gel pad. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The right foot was redressed with skin lubricant sterile gauze and Ace wrap. Anesthesia was reversed. The patient was brought back to the ICU in satisfactory condition.  What CPT® and ICD-10-CM codes are reported?</p>

                <p>Pregunta 45: PREOPERATIVE & POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Macromastia. 2. Back pain. 3. Neck pain. 4. Shoulder pain. 5. Shoulder grooving. 6. Intertrigo. NAME OF PROCEDURE: 1. Right breast reduction of 1950 g. 2. Right free-nipple graft. 3. Left breast reduction of 1915 g. 4. Left free-nipple graft. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: The patient is a 43-year-old female with macromastia and associated back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain, shoulder grooving and intertrigo. She desired a breast reduction. Because of the extreme ptotic nature of her breasts, we felt she would need a free-nipple graft technique. In the preoperative holding area, we marked her for this free-nipple graft technique of breast reduction. The patient observed these markings so she could understand the surgery and agree on the location, and we proceeded. The patient also was morbidly obese with a body mass index of 54. Because of this, we felt she met the criteria for DVT prophylaxis, which included Lovenox injection. The patient understood this would increase her risk of bleeding. She also made it known she is a Jehovah's Witness and refused blood products, but she did understand her risk of bleeding would significantly increase and we proceeded. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was given 40 mg of subcutaneous Lovenox in the preoperative holding area. She was then taken to the operating room. Bilateral thigh-high TED hose, in addition to bilateral pneumatic compression stockings were used throughout the procedure. IV Ancef 1 g was given. Anesthesia was induced. Both arms were secured on padded arm boards using Kerlix rolls. A similar body Bair Hugger was placed. The chest and abdomen were prepped and draped in sterile fashion. I began by circumscribing around each nipple-areolar complex using a 42 mm areolar marker. On each side the free-nipple grafts were harvested. They were marked to be side specific and were stored on the back table in moistened lap sponges. Meticulous hemostasis was achieved using Bovie cautery. The tail of the apex of each breast was de-epithelialized using the scalpel. I amputated the inferior portion of the breast from the right side. Again, meticulous hemostasis was achieved using the Bovie cautery. There were also large feeder vessels divided and ligated using either a medium Ligaclip or 3-0 silk tie sutures. I then moved to the left and again amputated the inferior portion of the breast. Meticulous hemostasis was achieved using the Bovie cautery. Each of these wounds were temporarily closed using the skin stapler. The patient was then sat up. I felt we had achieved a very symmetrical result. The new positions for the nipple-areolar complexes were marked with a 42-mm areolar marker and methylene blue. The patient was then placed in the supine position and the new positions for the nipple-areolar complexes were de-epithelialized using the scalpel. Meticulous hemostasis was then achieved again using the Bovie cautery. The free-nipple grafts were then retrieved from the back table. They were each defatted using scissors and were placed in an on-lay fashion on the appropriate side, and each was inset using 5-0 plain sutures. Vents were made in the skin graft to allow for the egress of fluid on each side. A vertical mattress suture was used, tied over a piece of Xeroform in critical areas of each of the nipple-areolar complexes. A Xeroform bolster wrapped over a mineral oil-moistened sponge was affixed to each of the nipple-areolar complexes using 5-0 nylon suture. The vertical and transverse incisions were closed using 3-0 Monocryl, both interrupted and running suture, and 5-0 Prolene. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Again, meticulous hemostasis was achieved using the Bovie cautery. She was given another 1 g of Ancef at the 2-hour mark by our anesthesiologist, and was taken to the recovery room in good condition.

OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: BILATERAL AUGMENTATION MAMMOPLASTY USING SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS. ANESTHESIA: General. OPERATIVE SUMMARY: The patient was brought to the operating room awake and placed in a supine position where general anesthesia was induced without any complications. The margins of the dissection were marked to be the sternal border within two fingerbreadths of the clavicle slightly beyond the anterior axillary line and slightly below the inframammary crease. The chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The left breast was done first. An inframammary crease incision was made going through skin. subcutaneous tissue, down to the muscle fascia. Dissection was then carried in the subglandular plane to the above mentioned areas. After careful hemostasis and irrigation with normal saline, an Allergan high profiled textured silicone gel implant was placed into this pocket. There was good shape for this area. The skin was closed after careful inspection for hemostasis with 4-0 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion for the deep subcutaneous tissue, 4-0 Monocryl in a superficial subcutaneous interrupted suture for the superficial layer, and then 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion for the skin. Antibiotic ointment and Tegaderm were applied. The right breast was approached in a very similar fashion. An Allergan implant 400 cc high profile silicone gel with a textured surface was also used. Skin closure was similar. The patient's left and right breast were very similar in size and shape. The patient had a bra applied. The patient tolerated this procedure well and left the operating room in stable condition. What CPT® codes are reported for this patient encounter?  </p>

                <p>Pregunta 47: INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: The patient is an 82-year-old male with biopsy-proven basal cell carcinoma of his right lower eyelid extending to the upper part of the cheek. I marked the area for rhomboidal excision and I drew my planned rhomboid flap. The patient observed these markings in a mirror, he understood the surgery and agreed on the location and we proceeded. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The area was infiltrated with local anesthetic. The face was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. I excised the lesion as drawn into the subcutaneous fat. Hemostasis was achieved using Bovie cautery. Modified Mohs analysis showed the margin to be clear. I incised the rhomboid flap as drawn and elevated the flap with a full-thickness of subcutaneous fat. Hemostasis was achieved in the donor site, the Bovie cautery was not used, hand held cautery was used. The flap was rotated into the defect. The donor site was closed and flap inset in layers using 5-0 Monocryl and 6-0 Prolene. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The total site measured 1.3 cm x 2.7 cm.
